# Extreme_rainfall_Event_forecasting

In forecasting rainfall, satellite imageries, ground observation stations and weather balloons
were used mostly. There is also radar imaging technology, but it is not yet an extensive
application due to the large image data.

Sequentially, a temporal interval of 12 hours is set to do rainfall forecast. Many scholars
have focused on improving the monitoring and forecasting of weather and developing the
technology to improve the ability to forecast heavy rainfall events.

In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence algorithm for rainfall forecasting has
attracted considerable attention. The mechanism of rainfall forecasting is a nonlinear system in
terms of mathematics.

Due to the rampant cases of cutting down of trees, the protective effects of trees against
flooding are slowly being removed. Therefore, the prediction of extreme rainfall events
becomes even more important. We can do two types of rainfall event forecasting :-

• Predicting rainfall over a few weeks or months in advance which is called Long Term
predictions.

• Predicting rainfall a few days in advance for a given area which is called Short Term
predictions.
